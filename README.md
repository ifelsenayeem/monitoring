# Monitoring system using collectd, graphite and grafana

## Introduction

Collectd is a daemon which collects system and application performance metrics periodically and provides mechanisms to store the values in a variety of ways. It gathers metrics from various sources, e.g. the operating system, applications, logfiles and external devices, and stores this information or makes it available over the network.
